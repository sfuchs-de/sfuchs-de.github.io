			<h3>The Spoils of War: Trade Shocks during WWI and Spain's Regional Development (Job Market Paper)</h3>
			<p class="abstract">This paper contributes new evidence on how labor market frictions can inhibit regional economic development and how a foreign demand shock can overcome them. I digitized new historical trade and labor market data to examine a trade shock to the Spanish Economy due to the participation of Spain's key trading partners in World War I (1914-18) while Spain remained neutral. I document that, firstly, WWI induced a large, temporary and sectorally heterogeneous demand shock that originated in belligerent countries, particularly France. Secondly, provincial income growth exhibited a spatial gradient, decreasing on average by 4\% for each additional 100km distance to Paris. Finally, provinces with a favorable industry composition in light of the shock grew faster than their pre-trend. To quantify the role of frictions in input and output markets, I build and estimate a quantitative multi-sector economic geography model that allows for sectoral and spatial labor market frictions as well as external scale economies. Estimated labor market frictions are high and the parameters suggest decreasing returns to be present in some industries, limiting gains from reallocation. The model is used to calculate the unobserved reallocation patterns during the shock. Spatial frictions dominated with an estimated 83 percent of reallocation of labor taking place within provinces rather than between. I then simulate labor reallocation patterns in the absence of the WWI trade shock. The shock increased the overall manufacturing sector by 14 percent, while shifting the national industry composition towards more advanced industrial sectors.</p>
			<h3>Globalization and Taste Heterogeneity: Evidence from Hollywood <i>with <a href="mailto:adlerkonrad@gmail.com">Konrad Adler</a></i></h4>
			<p class="abstract">We document two stylized facts for the international movie market. Firstly, that the share of revenue of sequels and adapted - non-original - content has increased dramatically over the last two decades, and that furthermore the global market has become geographically more diverse. We propose that this situation can be explained by considering a setting where firms face a global market where countries have horizontally differentiated taste, yet the firm has to release one global good for all markets. In this setting the firm needs to decide on the profit maximising location in the taste space that is populated by the consumers of the individual countries. If furthermore the firm faces production uncertainty, that affect the realized position of the product in the taste space, then there is a mean-variance trade-off between goods that provide more uncertainty but a better expected position, versus goods that are safer but have a worse expected position. In this setting the rise of the East Asian market has changed the taste diversity that the firms are facing, and sequels provide a safer option to hedge against this spatial risk. We propose a way of estimating this model and the production uncertainty based on a random utility framework.</p>
