			<h3>The Spoils of War: Evidence on the Impact of Trade Shocks from World War 1 (Job Market Paper)</h3>
			<p class="abstract">This study analyzes the role of the internal geography within a country in determining how an external shock affects its economic development. Using a trade shock to the Spanish Economy due to the participation of Spain's key trading partners in World War 1 (1914-18), I document that provinces diverged during the war, growing faster than their pre-trend in the most exposed provinces and slower in the least. To quantify the role of geographical frictions, I build and estimate a a quantitative economic geography model that nests the most commonly used frameworks, where labor demand is based on multi-sectoral trade and external scale economies, and where workers can move subject to switching cost, making labor supply depend on the initial distribution of workers. Controlling for differences in market access across locations, the endogenous mechanism of the model can explain about a third of the variation in income changes. Using the model to simulate the effect of the shock, I obtain labor market access indices describing spatial variation in labor supply conditions driven by competition for inputs in geographically partially segregated labor market. I find that they can account for a 35 percent of the observed variation in provincial population dynamics. Finally, the estimated model is then used to simulate Spain in the absence of the WW1 trade shock. Compared to this counterfactual the data shows substantial reallocation across sectors and provinces.</p>
			<h3>Globalization and Taste Heterogeneity: Evidence from Hollywood <i>with <a href="mailto:adlerkonrad@gmail.com">Konrad Adler</a></i></h4>
			<p class="abstract">We document two stylized facts for the international movie market. Firstly, that the share of revenue of sequels and adapted - non-original - content has increased dramatically over the last two decades, and that furthermore the global market has become geographically more diverse. We propose that this situation can be explained by considering a setting where firms face a global market where countries have horizontally differentiated taste, yet the firm has to release one global good for all markets. In this setting the firm needs to decide on the profit maximising location in the taste space that is populated by the consumers of the individual countries. If furthermore the firm faces production uncertainty, that affect the realized position of the product in the taste space, then there is a mean-variance trade-off between goods that provide more uncertainty but a better expected position, versus goods that are safer but have a worse expected position. In this setting the rise of the East Asian market has changed the taste diversity that the firms are facing, and sequels provide a safer option to hedge against this spatial risk. We propose a way of estimating this model and the production uncertainty based on a random utility framework.</p>
